      <p style="height:10vh; max-width:80vw; font-size:50px;overflow-y:hidden;"><strong>WHAT IS GOING ON?</strong></p>
      <p style="min-height:175vh;max-width:80vw; font-size:25px;overflow-y:hidden;">As much as everyone is familiar with the modern day global pandemic COVID-19, this severe notion has radically changed nearly every aspect of our lives. The common life has changed drastically, and the changes that we are observing around us today, many of us had not even imagined about this in the past. Say, it’s the reduced levels of pollution or the way all the nations are collaboratively standing against the pandemic without the urge of dominance. Everything has changed, locally, and internationally as well! It’s impact ranges from dismantling economies, healthcare, and society as a whole.
        In this pandemic, even the greatest economies and powers are trembling and falling. More than over 1.5 million of the human population has fallen prey to this global threat. America lost the most number of lives rounding above 20,580 deaths, and cases rounding to 533,115. Spain is losing its human resource at the quickest rate of 346 cases from the country per 100,000 cases in the world. It is followed by Italy, with a net figure of 244 per 100,000. Respectively, these countries saw the deaths of 16,972 and 19,648 people in their country. While the American and European subcontinents seem to be worstly affected, meanwhile in Asian region, Russia and India are going through the stage where cases are doubled every 3 days. While these countries situated miles apart are going through massive loss, China, where the first cases of coronavirus were reported, has knocked the virus, and reported only 3,339 deaths and 82,052 cases in its national boundary.
        More surprisingly, China claims that it has successfully controlled the spread of the virus. Also, the lockdown has been scraped-off from the city of Wuhan, which is the originating hotspot of the virus. This decision has gained severe criticism from major countries from all over the world and is being perceived as an irresponsible step of its government. Also criticised as a step fore-taken in hurry, in order to symbolize its existence as supreme in terms of capability to deal with a radical calamity.
        Although the Chinese Government has lifted-off the lockdown expecting the early stability in the country's economy, the first day witnessed the incident of strike by shop owners whose shops are situated in Wuhan. The crowd demanded the reduction in rents of the shops, which also seems obvious as the business has been closed for as long as 76 days of lockdown. Though the government proclaims that it has invariably restricted the spread of Coronavirus, the streets of Wuhan depict a contrary story, where the shop owners sat sparsely by distancing themselves from each other.
        Apart from the internal situation in China, it is not likely to attract the reputation from even the rest of the world. After calling the coronavirus spread as a ‘hoax’ for some duration, after the tragic effect of the same, Donald Trump, the President of the United State of America ended up calling the pandemic as ‘Chinese virus’. While China is the major manufacturer and dominant exporter of medical equipment, most of the nations seek the resources from China during this state of emergency. Instead of responding positively, China has delayed exports of equipment such as ventilators and masks on the grounds of quality inspections of the products. Additionally, the agency gave no indication of how long the quality testing may take. Also, after exporting the medical equipment to parts of Europe and few other countries, it has received a series of complaints about the quality of trade. Though it has officially emerged above the coronavirus, certainly China has not gained any goodwill during this pandemic. In short, the long term social impacts caused by COVID-19 can be attributed to unprecedented levels of xenophobic behavior, economic strain, and global panic.
