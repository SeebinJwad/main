charlieed.paterson@googlemail.com,"I am an entry level software developer on the autistic spectrum and have graduated from 3 months of full time study with Makers Academy, where I have learnt to use Javascript, HTML/CSS, Ruby, Rspec, Capybara, PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails. But more importantly, I've learnt the programming principles needed to continue building on and applying my skills in meaningful ways with good coding practices.

I also have a 2:1 BSc in Psychology and an interest in science, history, political economy and current world events. 

The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has had a profound effect on lives, communities and employment prospects everywhere which is why I've decided to take a stand and find a way to fight this pandemic with the skills I have.

I am eager to find any means within my talents to do my part.","Github: https://github.com/CpaterCodes
