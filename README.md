# #A Contained Calamity
We are going to spread positive, hopeful, yet realistic messages through the use of a chat-bot, social media, and a website!
All messages will be centered around the following claim: COVID-19 and it's global impact has incited mass hysteria which is a great opportunity for promoting cautious and safe behavior; however, doing so also encourages reckless and harmful actions. Such messages are spread by social media and people who believe they have scientific 'authority.' Rather than flagging such posts or defaming such people, both of which are unacceptable, we should spread current progress worldwide which has gone unrecognized. Personally, I feel many look to far into the dangerous environment of many medical workers, when also they should be looking at their amazing achievements and provide them more praise or be inspired to also take action rather than panic.

If you are good at UI/UX or are an avid programmer wanting to help, volunteer here:
